# texas_holdem
A texas holder game in Python, which will be CLI for now but maybe will implement into a front-end back-end app.

My current goals for this project are as followed:
1. Create a fully functioning dealing system with class Deck and class Card. (Partially Complete)
2. Create a functioning system where you can play a 6-handed game of texas holdem, with dynamic players, and different risk takers.
This would be implemented using properties such as 'bluff' or 'tight' - terms in poker which dictate the way players play. 
3. Create a CLI interface which is comfortable to use, and fun to play.
